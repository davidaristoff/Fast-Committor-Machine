# Fast Committor Machines
This repository contains codes associated with the results presented in [The fast committor machine: Interpretable prediction with kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10410) (arXiv preprint).

## Contents
* `FCM_triplewell.m` - MATLAB code for computing the committor using feature machines.
* `Triplewell Committor.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for computing a reference committor by FEM methods.  This depends upon [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) and [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/), along with the NumPy/SciPy/Matplotlib packages.
* `gromacs-plumed.zip` - Instructions for the alanine dipeptide metadynamics simulations, based on the tutorial https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.7/user-doc/html/masterclass-21-4.html
